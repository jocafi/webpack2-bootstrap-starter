# webpack2-bootstrap-starter

This project is a template to start using Webpack 2 and Bootstrap.

The file `./webpack.config.js` contains many comments to help you understand better how Webpack is configured to execute some actions.

This work is based on the nice videos tutorial about Webpack 2 developed by `Petr Tichy` which I give some important credits here.
